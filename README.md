# Face Engine

[![Face Engine Docker Image](https://dockerbuildbadges.quelltext.eu/status.svg?organization=holymatch&repository=faceengine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/holymatch/faceengine/)

The source code is for my dissertations A Deep Learning Based Face Recognition Application with Augmented Reality on Microsoft Hololens. This server is used to recognize person based on face database. 

# Run the server
It is highly recommand to use [face system docker compose](https://github.com/holymatch/facesystem) to run the Face Engine with the [Face Information Server](https://github.com/holymatch/faceweb).

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
